<b>Hello World!</b>

<p>I am Cassidy Lovley and I am a freshman at the University of Maine.</p>
<p>My major is Accounting. I originally got accepted as an Engineering major, but decided to change over the summer because I never liked science, so I figured I would have a hard time.  I am happy with my decision to change so far.  I took accounting classes in high school and loved them, so I am very excited.</p>

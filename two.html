<b>My favorite sport is basketball.</b>

<p>I have been playing basketball since I was five years old.  My dad got me a mini hoop and since then I was obsessed.</p>

<p>I played throughout elementary, middle, and high school.  Now that I am in college I miss playing competitively, but I still go to the gym and shoot around.</p>

<p>My favorite player is Kyrie Irving, who plays for my favorite team, the Boston Celtics.</p>

<P>He is one of the best point guards in the league and plans to take the Celtics to the NBA Finals this year.</P>

<p>Below is a link to the NBA website where you can get more information on the Boston Celtics and Kyrie Irving.</p>
